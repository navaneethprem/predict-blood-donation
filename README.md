# ü©∏ Predict Blood Donation ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a person is likely to donate blood again based on historical donation data. It uses classification techniques to assist blood donation centers in donor targeting.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset is sourced from a real-world blood donation study and includes:
- Recency: months since last donation
- Frequency: total number of donations
- Monetary: volume of blood donated
- Time: months since first donation
- Target: whether they donated in the following period

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TPOT (AutoML)
- Matplotlib

## üß† Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train-test split with stratification
- Logistic Regression model training
- AutoML with TPOT to optimize models
- Evaluation using AUC score
- Visualization of model performance

## üîç Key Outcome
- Successfully predicted potential donors with an AUC score of **X.XX**
- Used TPOT to automatically discover high-performing pipelines

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing
- Classification modeling
- AutoML (TPOT)
- ROC-AUC evaluation
- GitHub project structuring
